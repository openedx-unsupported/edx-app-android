 * Used as a wrapper for data that is exposed via a LiveData that represents an event.
 * The advantage of this approach is that the user needs to specify the intention by using
 * [Event.getContentIfNotConsumed] or [Event.peekContent]. This method models the events as part of
 * the state: theyâ€™re now simply a message that has been consumed or not.
